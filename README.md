# Faculty Profiles

Online profiles for GSAPP and Columbia University faculty.

## Field-Based Content

From the CU database, but editable:

*   Name

*   Office address
*   Phone

Additional fields:

*   biography
*   education

Online presence:

*   social media accounts

## Interface

Modular ("cards"?) where the user can add any of the fields above in any order they like. Perhaps an "add" and then a dropdown to choose which type from a pre-defined list. Could also create a new type if it's not already there (but would wait for approval).
